INTRO                                                          *wiki-md-intro*

wiki-md is a (yet another) wiki plugin for vim. It aims to be filetype- and
syntax-agnostic and build on core vim capabilities. In other words, it avoids
bloat and is versatile because it is small.

CORE                                                            *wiki-md-core*

The heart of wiki-md is a configuration variable called |g:wiki_root|. Set it
to the path where you would like to keep a wiki before the plugin loads. Any
file in this path will have `wiki` added to 'filetype'.

The addition is key: for example, a markdown file might have the filetype
`markdown.wiki`, meaning it uses both your markdown settings and your wiki
settings. Similarly, a sample java program could have 'filetype' equal to
`java.wiki` and a LaTeX document `tex.wiki`.

wiki-md and its users take advantage of this by adding settings, mappings,
and other bits of customization to |ftplugin|, |indent-expression|, or
|syntax| scripts for the wiki filetype.

wiki-md leverages this for one purpose by default: to set 'path' to include
the file-system tree rooted at |g:wiki_root| so that |gf|, `:find`, and
friends will all include wiki results. The author conceives of this as a
dynamic link system, where any word under the cursor in a file (text, code,
markup, or otherwise) can be used as a link under the core key-bindings.

USAGE                                                          *wiki-md-usage*

Install it with your favorite plugin manager and then take advantage of
the capabilities described in |wiki-md-core|. You may also like to lean on
functions in |wiki-md-functions|.

CONFIGURATION                                          *wiki-md-configuration*

Variables are documented with their defaults.

* *g:wiki_root*
The root of a file-system tree that should be treated as a wiki. >
    let g:wiki_root = expand('~/.wiki')
<
You may have more than one wiki by setting this variable accordingly, but it must be
done before the ftdetect script is loaded, and it can only have one value at
per vim session.

FUNCTIONS                                                  *wiki-md-functions*

                                                              *wiki#edit_root*
wiki#edit_root({how})
                Edits the root of the wiki tree as determined by {how}, a
                stringifed command like `':edit'` or `':split'`.

                                                                  *wiki#wikis*
wiki#wikis({glob})
                Returns a list of wikis under the root that match {glob}.

                                                                 *wiki#search*
wiki#search({pattern})
                Deprecated: |:vimgrep| is often too slow over the whole tree,
                and users probably want more customization. This will be
                removed in a future release. Instead, you should think of
                "wiki search" as "some search command using `g:wiki_root`"
                (you'll want to use |:execute|). Examples: >
                    " if your 'grepprg' needs -R
                    execute 'grep -R' pattern g:wiki_root

                    " ripgrep
                    set grepprg=rg\ --vimgrep
                    execute 'grep' pattern g:wiki_root

                    " vimgrep
                    execute 'vimgrep' pattern g:wiki_root.'/**'
<

                Uses |:vimgrep| to search the whole wiki tree for {pattern}.

                                                              *wiki#make_link*
wiki#make_link({file})
                (Idempotent) Creates a wiki entry named {file} if none exists.

                                                                   *wiki#goto*
wiki#goto({file}, {how})
                Creates a wiki entry named {file} if none exists, and then
                opens it via the string {how}, which should be one of
                    * `'edit'`      Open entry in current window
                    * `'split'`     Open entry in split window
                    * `'vert'`      Open entry in vertically split window
                    * `'tab'`       Open entry in new tab

                The default is `'edit'`.

                                                             *wiki#tree_index*
wiki#tree_index({root}, {prefix}, {exclude})
                Returns a string that represents a tree-like index of the
                wiki. {root} can be any directory. {prefix} is prepended to
                all entries (useful for making bulleted lists).

                Entries in the list {exclude} are removed from the result.

                                                             *wiki#flat_index*
wiki#flat_index({root}, {prefix}, {exclude})
                Similarly, returns a string that represents a flat, list-like
                index of the wiki. {root} can be any directory. {prefix} is
                prepended to all entries (useful for making bulleted lists).

                Entries in the list {exclude} are removed from the result.

                                                         *wiki#complete_wikis*
wiki#complete_wikis({ArgLead}, {CmdLine}, {CursorPos})
                Returns the list of wikis for completion in `:command`s: >
                    command -complete=customlist,wiki#complete_wikis ...
<
